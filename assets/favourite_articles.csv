Think of\nhim – and give the civil service the respect it deserves, 27 July). He was a lovely, immensely wise and thoughtful public\nservant. He did indeed face the “elite contempt” of Whitehall towards local government about which Prof John Stewart wrote so\ncompellingly many years ago.\n\nAs the then leader of Camden council (net budget £300m, 700 different services, rated excellent by the Audit Commission), I\nrecall being asked to talk to aspiring civil servants on their training programme. I advocated for more autonomy for local\ngovernment but also a requirement for senior civil servants to spend at least two years seconded to local government and/or\nthe third sector, only to be told by one (I kid you not): “The trouble with you lot, is that if we give you more money,\nyou’ll spend it on the mayor’s rose garden.” It fairly took my breath away. Nothing has changed.Jane RobertsLondon\n\n Tony Travers’s call for more two-way traffic between central and local government, which Polly Toynbee refers to, is\nabsolutely right. As a local government manager, I took part in a very half-hearted “secondments initiative programme” with a\ncivil service counterpart, which boiled down to a two-day visit to our respective places of work. More valuable was a two-\nweek exchange with my council’s twin town in France, where I found a much stronger sense of a unified public service, often\nreflected at political level in the dual mandates of city mayors with parliamentary seats.\n\nHere, the Conservatives view local government with contempt. If Labour wins the forthcoming election, it will have been out\nof power nationally for 14 years, with no experience of statecraft. Let’s hope it finds ways to draw on the political and\nmanagerial experience in Labour-run councils and mayoralties, and begins to build bridges between the two as Travers\nadvocates.David GriffithsHuddersfield, West Yorkshire\n\n Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

2023-07-28,Twenty renters fighting over each flat in Britain? I worry I’ll never find a place to call home | Anonymous,2023-07-27T15:26:42Z,Opinion,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/27/twenty-renters-flat-britain-home-landlords-agents-tenants,"'Soaring rents, intrusive questions, baffling rules: landlords and agents behave as they please because tenants are 10 a penny\n\nEarlier this year I found myself served notice on my flat after complaining to my landlord that he shouldn’t swear at us, his\ntenants. That is the standard I have grown to expect in the private rented sector, where ego runs roughshod over legal\nrights. With no way of challenging the notice, I needed to arrange some viewings – and fast.\n\nI found a friend who was willing to share. With the average one-bed flat in the area where I live costing more than £1,000 a\nmonth in rent alone, that’s a good friend to have. Every letting agent I phoned asked a whole ream of invasive screening\nquestions: what was the nature of our relationship? Did we have pets? Did we smoke? Did we work from home? How many cars did\nI have? What was my annual income? Did I have a permanent contract? How much did I have in savings? I had to provide all this\nbefore I could learn the address. It’s clear from the get-go that agents call the shots, and applicants suffer whatever\nindignities they must.\n\nMost of the letting agents we found weren’t willing to give a viewing to two professional sharers. They claimed this was\nbecause of licensing regulations but that’s not true. My local authority doesn’t require private landlords to be licensed\nuntil there are four or more tenants sharing one property. But the agents proved unwilling to consider that they might be\nmisapplying the regulations and denying people housing based on a misconception.\n\nLetting agents tend to keep office hours and aren’t flexible with times. Understandable, but not helpful to those of us\nemployed full-time, and especially stressful now that each renter is competing with 20 others just to view a property. The\n5pm slot for viewings is always the first to go, closely followed by anything at lunchtime. After two weeks of phoning around\nand clicking links, we found a property with a cancellation and were able to view it the following day, both begging our\nbosses for a single hour out of the office so we could find somewhere to live.\n\nWe arrived at an uninspiring ground-floor two-bed in a bland tower block. It’s not in an area we like or know well, there’s\nparking for one car only (we are both required to drive for our jobs), and the grounds are wholly communal. My friend really\nhated the idea of all the neighbours, delivery people, visitors and strangers wandering close by our windows, but beggars\ncan’t be choosers.\n\nAs the people viewing the flat before us left, we overheard the letting agent telling them how much interest they’ve had in\nthis property and that they wouldn’t be able to offer a second viewing until the following week – not that they expected it\nto still be on the market. The implication was clear: if you don’t take it now, someone else will.\n\nAt our viewing, the agent could offer no information about council tax bands, utility costs, the building’s waste collection\n– you know, the kinds of things everyone asks. They did take pains to point out how many viewings they’d had in such a short\ntime. Good for you, pal. The viewing took a total of four minutes. They couldn’t confirm if it was being let furnished or\nnot, despite the advert clearly stating it would be.\n\nWe asked for a few minutes so we could talk privately. The agent said we were welcome to, but it would have to be elsewhere\nas the next appointment was already waiting. Through the window we could see other viewers loitering hopefully. They asked\npoint blank if we were taking the property. Neither of us felt comfortable making such a large financial commitment off the\ncuff like that, but the pressure to say yes was palpable. Tenants are expendable. There will always be more people who need a\nhome.\n\nWe felt we had no choice but to take the place and carry on searching for a better property once we had somewhere to stay. I\nkeep an eye on property sites but anything we like is snapped up before the agent even gets back to us. We haven’t found a\nviewing for anywhere half decent in nearly three months. I’m worried we’ll be stuck here, unable to save enough towards a\ndeposit, constantly penny-pinching to meet rising bills, in a flat neither of us wants to call home.\n\nThe writer is in his 30s and lives in the south of England'"

Not because I especially mind them knowing modern life better than I\ndo, or shuffling quietly into the sidebar of the sitcom while they ascend to main character status; just because their rules\nare so time-consuming. Basically, you can’t leave any message on read. If it’s a question and you don’t know the answer, you\nneed a holding response. If it’s a meme and you like it, you need to laugh. If it’s an arrangement confirmed, you need a\nthumbs up, even if you suggested it so your cooperation is implied. If someone calls you, you have to pick up. If you don’t\npick up, you have to call them back, but not “in due course”, when you’ve finished whatever you’re doing, but immediately, as\nif someone might have died.\n\nI cling idiotically to the 20th century, where my phone works for me, I don’t work for it. It’s not unusual for me to get a\nmessage and just nod in assent, and then do my actual, in-real-life reply three days later. I am too old to learn and\nunlikely ever to change, but I now run a double standard, the worst of all possible worlds: boomer rules for myself and gen Z\nrules for everyone else. Boomer rules go under the umbrella “your mum’s Nokia corkscrew”. You can text her if you like, but\nshe won’t reply, because she keeps her phone in the cutlery drawer, where it lies, uncharged, for use on special occasions.\nBut when my friends don’t reply to me, I go full Snapchat generation: Why have they broken our streak? Does that previous,\ntimely back-and-forth mean nothing to them? Was there something wrong with the way I phrased it? Do they hate me now?\n\nThere’s precedent for Zoomers in the generation above Boomers, the so-called “silent” one (ha), who grew up when phones were\na relatively new invention and treat them like a fire alarm, demanding an immediate response, often accompanied by a small\nscream. My mum still uses her first phone number for her pin, because it only had four digits. How times change, how they\nremain the same.\n\n Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist.'"
